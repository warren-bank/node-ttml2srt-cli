To the three of us. Menage a trois!

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,240
In a village in Oxfordshire, on the
banks of the Thames, lives Britain's
most famous magician - Paul Daniels,

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,520
with his wife and former assistant,
Debbie McGee.

4
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,640
Now in their 60s and 40s
respectively, the couple are
entering a new phase in their lives.

5
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,800
They allowed me to spend some time
getting to know them.

6
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,200
I don't want you to film
at this door.

7
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,240
Come to the other door, cos this is
the bit we haven't finished, so...

8
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,440
<font color="yellow">OK. Sorry about that.</font> All right.

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,840
<font color="yellow">Hello, there!</font> Come in, Louis.

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,080
<font color="yellow">Shall I take my shoes off?</font> Um...yes,
please. <font color="yellow">Why not?</font> We've got ours off.

11
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,360
<font color="yellow">How are you doing?</font> <span tts:color="cyan">Not bad.
</span> <span tts:color="lime">He's just on the phone.
He'll be with you in a second.</span>

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,840
I'm in bare feet.
Look how small I am!

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,680
<span tts:color="lime">I haven't got high shoes on today.
This becomes the lounge. Very nice.

14
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,400
<span tts:color="yellow">This is amazing, the way this is
recessed. </span> Yeah. Debbie got a shock.

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,680
She went out. When she came back, no
chimney. <font color="lime">I had to get my whip out!</font>

16
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,320
I dunno... It works! Crikey! <span tts:color="yellow">What
is that? </span> It's a standard lamp, son.

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,120
<span tts:color="yellow">These books look like
they might be quite valuable. </span> Um...

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,600
Robert Houdin. <span tts:color="cyan">The father of modern
magic - Jean Eugene Robert Houdin.
Lived in the last century... </span> Nice.

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,200
Yes, the drawing. <span tts:color="yellow">Is it in all your
books? </span> Mm. It's called a book plate.

20
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,880
What about up here, Paul and Debbie?

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,640
<span tts:color="lime">Well, no. All the bedrooms are
currently being done. </span> Oh, they are.

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,160
<font color="cyan">Very good try!</font> We've allowed you in,

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,960
but we said until we'd finished the
house we weren't thinking of doing
anything. We want it to be finished.

24
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,800
I would like to see YOUR bedroom.
Is that done? <font color="cyan">Nope.</font> <font color="lime">No.</font> No?

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,720
<span tts:color="cyan">We just told you it wasn't! Please
pay attention! </span> Cheeky little monkey!

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,280
Wants us to take him up there,
but I'm not.

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,680
'With the bedroom off limits, it was
time to get down to business, and
the biggest reason why I was here.

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,560
'With Paul now retired
from the world of magic,

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,760
'Debbie was about to fulfil a dream,
setting up her own company -
Ballet Imaginaire - funded by Paul.'

30
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Here on the poster
it says, "Debbie McGee
for PDM International Presents..."

31
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,400
<span tts:color="yellow">So it doesn't actually say
Paul Daniels anywhere on the poster.
No. I'm just paying for it.

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,440
<font color="yellow">Can I ask how much?</font> We'll be
looking at about 300 grand, I think.

33
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:31,520
<span tts:color="cyan">We can't make a profit on the first
run. It's impossible. </span> So you're not
doing this for financial reasons?

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,160
<span tts:color="cyan">Not yet.
</span> What ARE you doing it for, then?

35
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm doing it because Debbie wanted
to do it. I think she's good at it.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,040
<span tts:color="yellow">The original impetus was yours,
Debbie? </span> Yep. With Paul's backing.

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,240
It was something he knew I wanted
to do, and he said go ahead.

38
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,360
You were with the Iranian National
Ballet? <font color="lime">Yes, I was.</font> So did you dance
for the Shah of Iran? <font color="lime">I did, yes.</font>

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,040
It was amazing.
<font color="yellow">Was he nice?</font> Lovely. And his wife.

40
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,720
I was there when the revolution
broke out and that's how I met Paul,
how I auditioned for his show.

41
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,160
I came home and all the English
ballet companies were full,
and I needed a job.

42
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,720
<span tts:color="yellow">You knew you'd be a magician's
assistant? </span> Well, no. I auditioned
for Paul's show as a dancer.

43
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,640
So for a good few years, while
you were working in the magic,

44
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,720
at the back of your mind there's
been this idea of going back
to ballet? <font color="lime">Yeah, absolutely.</font>

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,240
<font color="lime">It was always my first love.</font> It must
be weird for you, Paul, to get used
to being, in effect, the assistant -

46
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,000
<font color="yellow">now Debbie's the magician!</font> It's
wonderful. I've no problems with it.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,320
This is all your stuff. We should be
looking at this. <span tts:color="lime">If you want to,
Mr Cameraman. </span> Rehearsal schedule.

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,200
I don't like showing people
my untidy areas, but here we are.
These are all my files.

49
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,160
<font color="yellow">Is this your bag?</font> Yes. You don't
want to see my underwear, do you?!

50
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Paul.</font> My lacy knickers!

51
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,200
You can if you want.
I'm sure you've seen it all before.

52
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,400
<span tts:color="yellow">Are there tricks in the ballet?
It's got magical bits. Not tricks.

53
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,480
Paul just said there WERE tricks.
<font color="cyan">Magical happenings.</font> <span tts:color="lime">Yes,
special effects. </span> Magical happenings?

54
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:28,200
It's like Paul did... OK, you both
want to say magical happenings!

55
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,720
Paul did special effects
for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom...

56
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Phantom Of The Opera? <span tts:color="lime">Yeah. People
didn't watch it... </span> I've not seen it.

57
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,120
You don't think, "Oh, that's a magic
trick." <font color="lime">It's a magical happening!</font>

58
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,080
Come on then, duckies!

59
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,960
'At the end of our first day
together, I had a chance to reflect.

60
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,320
'I felt Debbie and I were getting on
pretty well. With Paul, I thought,
maybe there was more work to do.'

61
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,000
You're all perky this morning?

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,360
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font> Good morning, everybody.
..Would you like some orange juice?

63
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,080
Yes, please. I'd love a coffee.

64
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,800
<span tts:color="yellow">Can I give you a hand, Debbie?
No, you're all right.

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,240
<font color="yellow">You sure?</font> Nearly there. Coffee's on,
Louis. It'll wake you up
in a minute. Breakfast is coming.

66
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,400
What do you prefer?

67
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh!

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,560
I've got Frosties, Country Crisps,
Cornflakes, Weetabix and Shreddies.

69
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,480
Could I...could I get some
Weetabix and Cornflakes, please?
<font color="lime">Yep.</font> Together.

70
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,040
With the premiere
of Ballet Imaginaire looming,

71
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Paul and Debbie were moving
up to Lincoln for final rehearsals.

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,240
He and I went on ahead in his van.

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,120
We stopped for the Sunday Telegraph,
which had a feature about Debbie.

74
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,560
Shall I read it out? <span tts:color="cyan">If you like.
Can you read while we drive? </span> Yeah.

75
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,320
"Debbie McGee is pleasant,
thoughtful, hospitable, forthcoming.

76
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,200
"Considering what has been written
about her being a gold-digger,

77
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,960
"and she was the subject of sexually
depraved photographs..." <span tts:color="cyan">What?!
Oh, yeah.

78
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,080
Somebody on the Internet has...
mocked up some pictures, apparently,

79
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,840
and everybody writes to me -
I get a lot of e-mail about it.

80
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,400
I say, "Please,
if you know the site, tell me."

81
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,720
Because apparently
they're really bad.

82
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,000
Hi. <font color="yellow">Louis. How do you do?</font> Not bad.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,760
'Our next stop was at Paul's younger
brother Trevor's house, for a prop
he'd made for a magical happening.'

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,080
If you take that to a bank,
they'll laugh at you!

85
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,160
Take it to a chemist, they'll make
it up. "Take three times a day...!"

86
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,520
I've seen the show. <span tts:color="cyan">Yeah. That's
for your...all the stuff you spent.</span>

87
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,320
When we reached Lincoln,
Paul and Debbie got down to work.

88
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Debbie was rehearsing with the cast.

89
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,160
Artistic director and choreographer,
she was clearly in her element.

90
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,480
It's gotta have pzazz.

91
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,520
<span tts:color="yellow">What is your function here today?
</span> I keep a general, overall eye open.

92
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,800
I've always had an eye for detail.

93
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,280
<span tts:color="cyan">What's the delay now?
</span> Waiting for lighting, that's all.

94
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,600
I can't do a lot more...

95
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,760
The next day, rehearsals continued,
and so Paul took me to Doncaster,
to a warehouse where he keeps props.

96
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,720
Maybe we could do some tricks there.
<font color="cyan">You forgot to bring Debbie.</font> Meaning?

97
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,640
I'll be Debbie! <span tts:color="cyan">She's got to get in.
</span> # I'll be your Debbie tonight! #

98
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,400
<span tts:color="yellow">What about this?
</span> What've you got? What've you got?

99
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,440
Oh, I remember them. Yes.
They were a good act.

100
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,280
There you are.
Oh, it's quite clean inside.

101
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,080
<span tts:color="cyan">You see, if you stand there...
</span> Quite a tight squeeze, isn't it?

102
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,200
<font color="yellow">Is that safe?</font> It's all safe, yes.
You see, you're far too big for it.

103
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,200
<span tts:color="cyan">Do you see what I mean?
Close the door.

104
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,960
Right, I think
it's coffee-break time, don't you?
Everybody say yes to a coffee?

105
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,320
<font color="cyan">The team...</font> How long would you have
to stay in here for a magic trick?

106
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,800
Paul?

107
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,520
PAUL STAYS SILENT
<font color="yellow">It's quite nice in here.</font>

108
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,440
Hmm.

109
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,120
Well, I'm glad about that.
I'll tell you why.

110
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,240
All the boxes I make...
<font color="yellow">Please close it.</font> Please close it!

111
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,320
<span tts:color="yellow">Shouldn't I be elsewhere?
</span> No, you're supposed to be there.

112
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,000
Debbie has probably spent hours
in there. <font color="cyan">Well...</font> And you wonder
why she wants to do ballet!

113
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,400
<span tts:color="yellow">This is like a life's work in here,
isn't it? </span> A major part of my life,
yeah, is all stuffed in here.

114
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,120
But it's time for a new life.

115
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,920
When you stopped working with
the BBC, how did that come about?

116
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,600
Er...

117
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,080
They had a change of policy. I don't
think it was anything personal.

118
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,680
They just, um...decided...

119
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,600
not to do
a light entertainment show.

120
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,240
Did you feel at all hard done by?

121
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,480
How did they break it to you that
your services weren't required?
<font color="cyan">Well, they didn't break it to me.</font>

122
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
I found out from a dress designer
at a party.

123
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,920
Did you feel ill-used?

124
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,520
I don't think I felt ill-used. I
felt that they were extremely rude.

125
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,800
'I couldn't be sure,
but it was possible that
Paul and I were starting to bond.

126
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,760
'In Lincoln, the world premiere of
Ballet Imaginaire was drawing close.

127
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,840
'It seemed to be coming together.

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,280
'But I wondered what Debbie felt
about Paul's involvement.'

00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:38,000
<span tts:color="yellow">Do you worry that Paul might feel
left out? </span> <span tts:color="lime">I did worry at first
that he would. But he doesn't.</span>

130
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,360
He is a part of it
because of me anyway,
and he's done a lot of work for it.

131
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,120
This morning, he's off collecting
the photographs and things.

132
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,640
He's going to make a display
for the foyer.

133
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,680
But when you think about it,
it's quite a comedown from being
the nation's favourite magician.

134
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,880
<font color="yellow">Pinning up photographs.</font> But he wants
to do it. He's helping me. And...

135
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:12,320
Paul's like that. You know, he's
been famous for such a long time,
Louis, it's nice to have a break.

136
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,960

'To publicise the ballet,
Debbie was doing phone interviews.'

138
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,840
Thank you. ..Yep, absolutely.
A childhood dream come true.

139
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,640
It sounds very sugary, doesn't it?
But, yeah, ballet was my first love.

140
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,760
I put that on the shelf for 20 years
to work in television as a "box
jumper", as they call assistants!

141
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,600
..Yeah. Box jumpers -
jumping in and out of illusions.

142
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,360
..What we've always thought
when we read those articles is,

143
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,040
"What do they know?
Aren't we lucky that we're happy?"

144
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,480
When they wrote I was a bimbo...
It never hurt me, cos they don't
know what qualifications I've got.

145
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,240
Thanks, Peter. Bye-bye.

146
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,400
<span tts:color="yellow">That was more in-depth
than I thought it would be. </span> I know.
He'd done his homework. <font color="yellow">He had.</font>

147
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,200
What was the question about a bimbo?

148
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,320
Oh, about getting hurt
about what the papers write?

149
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,480
When Paul and I got married, they
all wrote that it would never last,

150
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,560
and that I was a magician's
assistant with no brains.

151
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't consider myself a bimbo, but
I like wearing glamorous clothes.

152
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,120
If I really was a bimbo, um...

153
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,440
So what, anyway? You know?

154
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,760
Come on! We have to walk faster!
<font color="yellow">Why fast?</font> Cos I don't walk slowly.

155
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,760
And I'm almost late.
No, I'm on time. It's not far.

156
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,840
<font color="yellow">How are you doing?</font> How do you do?
<font color="lime">Roger, isn't it?</font>

157
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,440
They're going to transform me now.

158
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,880
<span tts:color="lime">So, um...you have to go, so that...
What about if we just wait here?

159
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,960
<font color="lime">No, you can't, Louis.</font> Can't we watch
from here? <font color="lime">Go on. No, no, look.</font>

160
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:10,480
<font color="lime">We'll dye your hair blond!</font> It might
be a harassment to other customers.
<font color="yellow">There aren't any! Where are they?</font>

161
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,920
<font color="lime">Yes, this lady.</font> She's looking
harassed. <span tts:color="yellow">You're all right,
aren't you? You don't mind us?</span>

162
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,920
She doesn't want her friends to see
her under the hairdryer. Nor do I.

163
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,000
<span tts:color="lime">I'll be finished at about 12.30,
won't I? Two hours?!

164
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,720
<font color="lime">Yeah.</font> It's a long job.

165
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,520
All right? <span tts:color="lime">OK? 
See you later. <font color="lime">Bye.</font> <font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

166
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,280
With two hours to kill,
I went for a cup of tea
and spotted Paul in the high street.

167
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,040
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

168
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,240
Debs, there's a film crew
up the high street,

169
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,160
for some reason taking pictures
of a cafe. Where are you?

170
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
<font color="yellow">Paul!</font> Hello? Where are you?

171
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,160
Hello?

172
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,200
Welcome to Lincoln,
the twilight zone. Phones do not
work! <font color="yellow">Paul...</font> Oh, there you are!

173
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,720
Here's Debbie again.

174
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,280
<font color="cyan">Hello?</font> <span tts:color="yellow">She's getting her hair done.
I'm in the hairdresser's.

175
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,560
She's in the hairdresser's.
..I'm gonna buy shoes.

176
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,600
<font color="yellow">How are you, Debbie?</font> <span tts:color="lime">You've got
Louis with you, have you? </span> Yes!

177
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,760
<font color="cyan">Life is not perfect.</font> You don't
mean it, but it's still hurtful.

178
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,040
<font color="lime">Are you going shopping?</font> I'm going
to buy shoes cos I forgot 'em. Bye.

179
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,640
<span tts:color="yellow">See you later, Debbie... Oh. You
don't hang around, do you? </span> No, no!

180
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,600
She's seen us.
Can we come in? <font color="lime">Of course.</font>

181
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,400
<span tts:color="yellow">You take a lot of pride in your
appearance and it shows. </span> Thank you.

182
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,440
<span tts:color="yellow">D'you think Paul takes a lot of care
of his appearance? </span> He's very clean.

183
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:12,760
<font color="yellow">Hygiene?</font> Yeah.
<font color="yellow">What about clothes?</font> He's more
interested in other things.

184
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,280
He's got quite funny fashion sense.

185
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,240
He likes colourful things. <span tts:color="yellow">He does.
</span> He's not, sort of, dowdy,

186
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,480
but he's not interested
in men's fashion at all.

187
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,040
That Telegraph article
said that you convinced him
to abandon the wig. Is that true?

188
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,320
I thought he looked better
without it. <font color="yellow">Did you?</font> Yeah.

189
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,040
<font color="yellow">Would he wear it in bed?</font> Oh, no.

190
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,560
Maybe he did before he met me.
You'll have to ask him that one.

191
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,440
That's a good one, isn't it, Louis?
That's made us all laugh.

192
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,760
So, he'd be like, "Good night,
Debbie. Let's brush our teeth and
I'll take my wig off and then..."

193
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,280
<font color="yellow">It'd be quite funny.</font> D'you know
what we use his old wigs for now?

194
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,360
<span tts:color="yellow">Cleaning the car.
No. Keeping the teapot warm.

195
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,000
<font color="yellow">No!</font> Not really! That's a Debbie
joke. <font color="yellow">Is that a Debbie joke?</font> Yeah.

196
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,240
<font color="lime">This is Louis Theroux.</font> <span tts:color="yellow">You're Chris
and you own the theatre. </span> 'Fraid so.

197
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,000
And you donated two weeks
of the theatre space. <font color="lime">Three.</font>

198
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,320
I haven't told her what she's gotta
do yet! We're negotiating. <font color="lime">We are.</font>

199
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,040
<span tts:color="yellow">Oh, my God, there's a...
</span> <span tts:color="lime">A swan. We're trying this out.
It's not finished.</span>

200
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,080
<font color="yellow">How are ticket sales?</font> We're sold
out. <font color="yellow">Every night?</font> All three nights.

201
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,000
Can't do better. <span tts:color="yellow">Congratulations.
</span> I could kiss everybody.

202
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,440
I think it's great that they've sold
out with a new company. Fabulous.

203
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,960
Here it comes again.

204
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,320
It hasn't got any feathers on,
but we're still not sure about it.

205
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,640
If ever that falls over,
you're in major schtuck.

206
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,560
David, could you do that again...?

207
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,720
Who's doing that? How is it moving?

208
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,080
We have a...
<font color="lime">We don't look at things like that!</font>

209
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,600
We don't film things like that.

210
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,640
<font color="lime">That takes away the magic.</font> Don't be
ridiculous. <span tts:color="lime">People don't want to
know it works. They don't.

211
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,160
No-one thinks that's a real swan.
<font color="lime">No...</font> It's just a cardboard cutout.

212
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:50,120
If someone wants to know
how we do it,
they have to pay us for our method.

213
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,680
Is that a privileged technique?

214
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,200
<span tts:color="lime">Absolutely, so...
We can see this, though.

215
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:03,240
You don't give things like that
away. <font color="yellow">But we can show this.</font> Yeah,
but don't show things like that.

216
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,800
So, please... Please?

217
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,560
Especially as Paul's not here.

218
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,400
If he says it's all right, it's OK,
but otherwise, no.

219
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,480
Is that one of Paul's designs?

220
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,800
Yeah. He made it,
I think, or his brother.

221
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,360
<span tts:color="lime">I'm going to check some other
things. I'll see you later. </span> OK.

222
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,720
I hope it works for her.
They've spent a lot of money.
It's a very brave move.

223
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,760
Anyone who goes into producing now
is normally very foolish,

224
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,840
but at the least very, very brave.
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

225
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,080
Why? Because 95% of shows that open
lose money.

226
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,720
And what do you think of the...swan?
The mechanical sawn.

227
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,080
Er...personally, I wouldn't use it.
That's my opinion.

228
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,600
I thought it was looking all right.

229
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,360
D'you wanna say that again? <span tts:color="yellow">It
looked all right. </span> Without the smile.

230
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,240
<span tts:color="yellow">It was!
</span> I think it's great, the swan(!)

231
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,160
The big day - Ballet Imaginaire's
first night, and the crew are in
early getting everything in place.

232
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,920
There were still some problems,

233
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:43,960
and with Paul and I getting
on better, I saw a chance
to be involved in the production.

234
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,520
Would it be OK
if I pulled the swan tonight?

235
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,200
<font color="cyan">It would not. Ask me why.</font> Why?

236
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,400
You have a devious and distorted
sense of humour.

237
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:04,240
You know if you entrusted that
to me I'd be a model of efficiency
and decorum. <font color="cyan">I don't know that.</font>

238
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,280
I would expect it, but, then, you
might want to create the unexpected.

239
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,160
You're not in charge. Debbie is.

240
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,800
This is wonderfully true.
It's great.

241
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,480
I suggested to Paul that maybe
I could work the swan this evening.

242
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,360
<font color="lime">That's entirely up to him.</font> You were
on the fence about it, weren't you?

243
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,400
What? <font color="yellow">Me working the swan.</font> <span tts:color="lime">Not on
opening night. </span> Not on any night.

244
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,240
<span tts:color="yellow">Maybe later in the run.
Not on ANY night.

245
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,320
I've been getting these beautiful
flowers. <span tts:color="yellow">Oh, aren't those nice?
</span> All these good-luck cards.

246
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,160
Would you like a tea or a coffee?

247
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,840
'With all the first-night
preparations seemingly in hand,

248
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,480
'Debbie wrote good-luck cards
to the dancers.'

249
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,520
<span tts:color="lime">My husband's a real chatterbox. Can
you hear him? </span> He does go on a bit.

250
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,200
Well, I mean it's nice.

251
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,760
Nice to talk.

252
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,400
<span tts:color="yellow">What are you doing up there?
Waiting for MY cup of tea.

253
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,920
Debbie, d'you know...?
Can I say this, Paul,
what Debbie reminded you of?

254
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,480
She knows already. <font color="yellow">Does she?</font> Yeah.

255
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,600
The little mannequin
that separated the paragraphs
in Penthouse or Playboy.

256
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,120
<font color="yellow">What did you think?</font> I'd never seen
it, so I couldn't form an opinion.

257
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:39,000
Very attractive.
And the oddity, and it is an oddity
in this day and age of "who cares?",

258
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,800
is that Debbie's still
the same shape. She's fabulous.

259
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,440
You do have a great figure. <span tts:color="lime">Thanks.
</span> Is that part of not having children?

260
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,840
<font color="cyan">No.</font> No, I think... People say that,

261
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,280
but look at Jane Seymour
and how many children she's had
and she's got an amazing figure.

262
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,360
<span tts:color="yellow">Was there a...? Did you ever want
to have kids, Debbie? </span> No, never.

263
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,200
<font color="yellow">D'you know why?</font> No, I don't.

264
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,360
I didn't play with dolls
when I was little. I read books.

265
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,960
There hasn't been a moment where
I've thought, "I should have one."

266
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,520
<font color="lime">I've never questioned it...</font> I just
worked out that this thing I keep
sticking up my nose is a mike cover.

267
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,320
<font color="yellow">Milk, Paul?</font> Milk and sugar, please.

268
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,080
Is there a fear that Debbie will
become too beloved of the public?

269
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,600
I am well aware
that the world of show business

270
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,760
is a very...transient thing.
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font> It just comes and it goes.

271
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,840
Debbie's going into her prime,
really. <font color="cyan">Yeah.</font> Aren't you, Debbie?

272
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,920
I suppose so. It does feel that way.

273
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,600
<font color="lime">Yeah, it's exciting.</font> That's quite
a lot of pressure on a relationship.

274
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,600
<font color="yellow">In a way, it is.</font> <span tts:color="cyan">No, it isn't.
</span> I think it depends on the people.

275
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,640
The thing is with Paul is
that he has an unbelievable talent
which I know that I haven't got.

276
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,840
I haven't got that extra something
he's got,

277
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:21,000
and people who become stars like
Bruce Forsyth, Jimmy Tarbuck, Paul,

278
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,400
have something extra
which other performers don't have.

279
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,480
Paul and Debbie throw a party
for theatre managers,
friends and family,

280
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,840
including Debbie's mum, Babs,
dad, Pat, and sister, Donna.

281
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,160
'This is your five-minute call.'

282
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,640
<font color="cyan">Enjoy it, girls.</font> Thank you.

283
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,240
And then it was showtime.

284
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,280
I'd never seen any ballet before,
so I didn't know what to expect.

285
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,120
The show's in three parts - two
of them classical and one brand new.

286
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,640
The classical sections were extracts
from Swan Lake and Coppelia.

287
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,680
I couldn't follow all the action,
but the dancers seemed excellent.

288
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:12,520
The third part was called
The Artist's Dream, with a story
by Paul and choreography by Debbie.

289
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,600
It was the most interesting part,
with a West End musical feel to it,

290
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,760
about an artist who falls asleep
and is visited by a dream maker
who brings the painting to life.

291
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,440
It also used the magical happening
designed by Paul,
built by his brother, Trevor.

292
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,600
It had been a really good show
and the audience loved it.

293
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,360
Well done, everybody.

294
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,600
Whoa! There's people out there
from New York saying, "Never seen
anything like it." They loved you.

295
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,280
Whoa-ho! That was so good. Whoa!
I might take this dancing up.

296
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,480
<font color="cyan">Will you marry me again?</font> Yes.

297
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,920
CHEERING

298
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,000
<font color="lime">Thank you, darling.</font> Wow.

299
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,320
Debbie, a small token of
congratulations and felicitations.

300
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,960
Louis! Have we got a straw(?)

301
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,840
<span tts:color="lime">Thank you. You've been so wonderful.
Thank you. Thank you.

302
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,560
He's just trying to get into your
bedroom. He's been trying for weeks!

303
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,680
<span tts:color="lime">But you're always there, darling.
Little old party pooper me!

304
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,160
<span tts:color="cyan">You hold the matches
and you go one, two, three. </span> Oh, God.

305
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,200
<span tts:color="yellow">Was Paul joking about my trying
to get in the bedroom? </span> He was.

306
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,720
You haven't got to grips
with his sense of humour.
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing as a joke.</font>

307
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,240
<span tts:color="yellow">He doesn't want us in there.
</span> Is he worried that you fancy me
and I fancy you?

308
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,760
<span tts:color="yellow">The chemistry can't be denied.
Do we think this is true?

309
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,920
Here's to Paul and Debbie
and Ballet Imaginaire.

310
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,880
'Ballet Imaginaire's first night
had been a success.

311
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,040
'I thought that might warrant
a drink in Paul and Debbie's room.'

312
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,600
No. Remember the rules. You never
see the bedroom. Good night, Louis.

313
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,600
That was a joke, right?

314
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
Nope.

315
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:02,880
The following morning,
and the dancers and Paul and Debbie
left to begin touring the country.

316
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,400
My plan was to catch up with them
later in the tour.

317
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,200
When I next checked in, the tour
had reached Stirling in Scotland.

318
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,720
Things weren't going to plan.
Ticket sales were down, with Paul
blaming the petrol crisis.

319
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,240
The company was losing money.

320
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:29,120
<font color="yellow">Are you worried at all?</font> No, I have
written off the loss, mentally.

321
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:36,240
<font color="yellow">How much?</font> Oh...shall we say...
well in excess of &#163;100,000,
you know? <font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

322
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,640
<font color="cyan">And, er...</font> Cos before you were
saying you'd not quite break even.

323
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,920
I thought maybe &#163;20,000
would go down the tube.
<font color="yellow">Now it's &#163;100,000.</font> Plus.

324
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,360
And you're gonna go back on the road
touring the Paul Daniels Magic Show.

325
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,520
This, in terms of economics,
will be very useful
to help to fund the ballet.

326
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,240
My life is now wrapped up
in the ballet and Debbie,

327
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,680
so it's not just me paying my bills,
it's me keeping this product there.

328
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,840
<span tts:color="yellow">How does Debbie feel about it?
</span> <span tts:color="cyan">When this hit in, Debbie, whose
initial reaction was, "Blimey...!"</span>

329
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,720
<font color="yellow">When what hit in?</font> The loss.
<font color="yellow">The loss.</font> The amount of the loss.

330
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,680
And the fact that the theatres
weren't going to be sold out.

331
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,160
Well, we were prepared for a loss,
but not this volume.

332
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,720
'With fewer than half the tickets
sold for tonight's performance,
we drummed up an audience.'

333
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:47,320
Wanna come? <span tts:color="white">When we're finished.
</span> Just say, "Paul Daniels said
we could come and watch the ballet."

334
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,440
<span tts:color="cyan">D'you wanna come and watch it?
</span> We might do, actually.

335
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,800
<span tts:color="cyan">It starts in five minutes.
Paul, these guys are coming.

336
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,520
<font color="yellow">They're not paying?</font> What? <span tts:color="yellow">They're
not paying? </span> I don't want them to.

337
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,080
I just want 'em to get interested.
Next time we come, they'll pay.

338
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,080
Please...your friends went this way.

339
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:21,080
The next day,
Paul had been booked to appear
on Celebrity Ready Steady Cook,

340
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,600
so we broke away from the tour.

341
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,680
He was now committed to coming out
of retirement with a new magic show.

342
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,320
The appearance is useful publicity.

343
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,440
<span tts:color="yellow">Will you do some magic on the show?
No? No.

344
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,800
Not at all.

345
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,080
I think you shouldn't cross
that kind of boundary.

346
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,560
If they want that,
they should plan that in advance.

347
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,480
Magic should not just be a passing
thing. It should be thought through.

348
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,000
Are you ready for a bit of cooking?
<font color="cyan">No, I can't cook.</font>

349
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,840
'From the moment we arrived,
I sensed Paul was out of sorts.'

350
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,840
<font color="yellow">Who is Paul up against?</font> Anna Ryder
Richardson from Changing Rooms.

351
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,680
Anna Ryder Richardson, Paul.
It's A-list.

352
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,240
<span tts:color="yellow">..He doesn't know who she is.
..From Changing Rooms. </span> That's good.

353
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,280
Are you gonna do some tricks? <font color="cyan">No.</font>

354
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,800
<font color="cyan">I'm Paul Daniels.</font> I'm Anna. Hi.

355
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,240
Hello. <span tts:color="white">This is Chris, our director.
Nice to meet you. </span> Hi, Chris.

356
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,480
Er...just shoot me like a football.

357
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,520
OK. Have you seen the programme?
<font color="cyan">No.</font> No.

358
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,520
That's where you come through.
<font color="cyan">Who opens them?</font>

359
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,320
A man opens them for you. <font color="cyan">Right.</font>

360
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,840
So you start up here.

361
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,560
Pop you in behind.
Your bag'll be in here already.

362
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,400
<font color="cyan">Hmm.</font> Does it look all right, Paul?

363
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:09,960
I'm just curious. Did you not find
that interesting - you push one open
and they both open? <font color="yellow">No.</font>

364
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,080
It's got a pulley system.
You're not curious at all, are you?
Must be counterweighted.

365
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,160
Ainsley'll be in the middle.
<font color="white">He'll be here.</font> Swing round, then.

366
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,400
He'll push you through to there.
Lesley'll be here.

367
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,920
So, we'll probably...
Lesley will give you the first thing
you need to do.

368
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,000
We'll get all the pots and pans
ready.

369
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,880
On the word "cook", put the apron on.
It's over there. <font color="cyan">I can't reach it.</font>

370
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,560
Ainsley'll help you. <span tts:color="cyan">All right, then.
No.

371
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:54,480
At the end of 20 minutes, we stop
cooking. <font color="cyan">Yep.</font> We send you out
and the audience vote. <font color="cyan">OK.</font>

372
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,320
<span tts:color="yellow">You all right, Paul?
</span> You going to do any magic?

373
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,840
Not as far as I know.

374
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,680
Shall I carry on...?
<font color="yellow">Are you just pacing out, Paul?</font>

375
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:18,080
After 20 minutes we leave
the studio, the audience votes
and we taste the food.

376
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,360
You have taken it all in. <span tts:color="cyan">Yes,
sorry, love. I'm terrible at that.</span>

377
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,960
<span tts:color="cyan">I tend to wander off but I am
listening all the time. </span> Brilliant.

378
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,800
I was getting the feeling that
Paul didn't like this kind of show.

379
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,080
To change the mood,
I asked him about his autobiography.

380
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,320
In your, um, autobiography,

381
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:46,160
there is quite a bit
about your...your sexploits.

382
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,000
I had a good time, yeah. It was
a time for having a good time.

383
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Was it? <span tts:color="cyan">Yeah.
</span> '70s, '80s - '70s, was it?

384
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:01,400
Yeah, it would be, I guess.
<span tts:color="yellow">And is that true about the
more than 300 partners? </span> Er...yeah.

385
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,880
Was that groupies
who would turn up to your show?

386
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,760
Sometimes. Yeah, sometimes.

387
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,800
It was just...there was a lot
of sex around because the girls
had discovered the Pill,

388
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,480
and started to do everything
the lads had been doing for years.

389
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,440
I was on my own...and travelling...

390
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,480
and so it...it was just the scene.

391
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,240
Then along came herpes and AIDS
and all that...

392
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,880
And Debbie.

393
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,200
Oh, yeah. And Debbie.

394
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Could you remember all the names?
Or was it like "That one
in the back of the Cortina"?

395
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,640
The Cortina!

396
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,440
Oh, dear... I DID have a Cortina
at one time.

397
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,360
AINSLEY HARRIOT: Hello, Paul.

398
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,240
<font color="cyan">Ainsley.</font> Lovely to see you again.
Family well?

399
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,000
Er...yes. I see Debbie again...
I'll check with Louis.

400
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,240
<span tts:color="cyan">When do I see Debbie again?
Saturday. Louis knows, does he?

401
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,280
How do you do? Pleased to meet you.
<font color="white">We met before, didn't we?</font> Probably.

402
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,200
In the corridors. <span tts:color="yellow">The corridors
of power. </span> Drifting around.

403
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,840
- Lights up.
- Four, three, two...

404
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:24,160
AINSLEY: He has stunned audiences
all over the world with his magic.
Ladies and gentlemen,

405
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,080
Paul Daniels!

406
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,680
APPLAUSE

407
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,200
Oh, lovely!

408
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,960
What about you going on tour?
Are we going to see more of you?

409
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,400
It's called "An Audience With".

410
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,240
And Debbie is on the road with
a ballet company I help manage.

411
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,000
Beautiful. That's lovely.
Game of cards?
I haven't got time.

412
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,760
Do you want a trick,
ladies and gentlemen? 

413
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,360
Here's a good one.
Pick a card. Any card.

414
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,640
Do you like that one? <span tts:color="white">Yeah.
</span> Four of spades. Saves time.

415
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,960
Five, four, three, two, one.

416
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,480
Mm! That's good! Isn't that tasty?

417
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,880
That meal was delicious!
She is one good cook!

418
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,640
<span tts:color="yellow">She was good, wasn't she?
You weren't helping much. </span> I can't.

419
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,720
I didn't know what the hell
was going off up there.

420
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,960
And then it rained. In fact,
it rained so much that the Thames
flooded Paul and Debbie's house.

421
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,160
Will it all be covered
by the insurance? <font color="cyan">Oh, yes.</font>

422
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,520
<span tts:color="yellow">How much water was in here, then?
About an inch.

423
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,160
<span tts:color="yellow">How does it look upstairs?
The same as it did before.

424
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,600
<span tts:color="lime">That you didn't see before.
The bit you never get to see.

425
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,040
Maybe it would make sense for me
to have a quick look. <font color="cyan">No!</font>

426
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,600
<font color="lime">No.</font> I like you.
..Not a lot, but...!

427
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,120
'Ballet Imaginaire were playing
Harlow. I gave Paul and Debbie
a lift.'

428
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:26,280

ballet's financial problems would
put a strain on their relationship,

</span> Doing his magic show.

That's where you met Debbie,

</span> Could have been you.

Not to the camera, please!

441
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,840
<font color="yellow">To me!</font> I was looking for you!
How can I see you
if you're behind me, already?!

442
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,240
'Paul and I were getting on better
than we ever had before.

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,480

447
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,200
Paul, what do you think
of these ones?

448
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,440
Who is Paul Daniels?
<span tts:color="white">He's a magic magician man.
</span> Magic magician man?

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,280
<font color="yellow">Do you know his wife's name?</font> No.
<font color="cyan">Ahh! I bet you would...</font> Mrs Daniels.

450
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,120
After the performance, I wanted
to ask about Paul's change of mood.

451
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,480
Did you have a word with Paul? I
know we had a conversation about...
Here he comes.

452
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,600
<font color="yellow">Paul.</font> We're talking about you.

453
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,920
I'm delighted. The box office
said they've never had as many
people in for a dance show.

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:40,560
<font color="cyan">Are you coming with me?</font> <span tts:color="lime">No, Louis's

Trust me. Come home with me!

<span tts:color="lime">No, I'm coming home with you.
See you soon!

456
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,760
We'll be with you in a minute.

457
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,600
So, no, but...it seems silly
but he seems much warmer,
much less suspicious.

458
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,960
<span tts:color="lime">No, I didn't say anything.
Have you noticed?

459
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,680
He's just a bit more
relaxed himself. <font color="yellow">Why?</font>

460
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,040
He was worried when you were
first with him...

461
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,800
A) because we didn't know
what you were going to be like...

462
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,960
He worried about what you're going
to say. Do you like us?
We're not your sort of people.

463
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,360
No, I like you. Is that what
you were worrying about?

464
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:27,800
We thought you'd think
we were old-fashioned
and not into the things you're into.

465
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:35,120
So Paul, particularly - not me
so much - felt, "Oh," you know,
"we won't be your sort of thing."

466
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,520
Maybe because he's going back on
the road and he's doing this show.

467
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,880
He needs goals, doesn't he?
<font color="lime">Yeah...</font> To be busy with.

468
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,480
WHISTLE
<span tts:color="lime">The whistle. He wants me to go,
"Woof woof, I'm coming!"</span>

469
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:56,000
<span tts:color="yellow">Amazing! Whistle back.
</span> <span tts:color="lime">People think, "It's awful!
He thinks you're a dog!"</span>

470
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,080
But we always used to lose each
other... <font color="yellow">I never said it.</font>

471
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,480
It was our last full day
of filming,

472
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,080
and Paul and I dropped in
to see Keith and Mervyn,
his management team.

473
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:15,440
They had business to discuss
and we were asked to leave the room.

474
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,000
The meeting left Paul
in an angry mood.

475
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,600
Come on, you bugger! Move your arse!

476
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,640
What happened in the meeting?
<font color="cyan">Mr Nasty!</font> Can you tell us
what happened?

477
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,440
What? <span tts:color="yellow">What happened in the meeting?
</span> What meeting?

478
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,560
<span tts:color="yellow">The one we weren't allowed to see.
Oh, that? It's all right.

479
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,000
<font color="yellow">Come on. You can tell us.</font> You're not
interested in my money. <font color="yellow">We are!</font>

480
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,400
We are, Paul.
Was it about the ballet?

481
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,440
Was it about the ballet?

482
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:58,640
So what happened in that meeting?
Can you tell us?
What were Keith and Mervyn saying?

483
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,640
They were saying...

484
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,680
do I...do I force them...

485
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,200
into continuing to spend
a lot of time on finding odd dates
in the spring

486
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,520
or do I put them
into saturating the autumn?

487
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,560
So Mervyn and Keith
have been faxing theatres

488
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,520
saying, "Would you like to see
Ballet Imaginaire?"

489
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,440
No, they've been faxing theatres
with both shows.

490
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,520
And getting a great response
on Paul Daniels Audience...

491
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,720
The theatres are...some are taking
it, or want to take it.

492
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,240
Most of them already have ballet in.

493
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,280
A more muted response on the ballet
because they've already got ballet.
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font> So what were they...?

494
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:52,480
<span tts:color="yellow">Keith and Mervyn ware saying...
</span> They cannot make the decisions.
They are there to do a job.

495
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,680
And they... <span tts:color="yellow">Expressed the opinion...
</span> They asked me...

496
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,720
do I still...do they still
keep on going...with the spring,

497
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,240
or pull the plugs on the spring
from the public point of view,
go for it just for the sponsorship.

498
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,880
<span tts:color="cyan">I said I had to think about it.
Because they haven't...

499
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:21,800
At the same time,
the Louis Theroux A-Team...
nah, the Louis Theroux Z-Team...

500
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,720
have asked me to do things and I'm
having to think about the business.

501
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,400
<span tts:color="cyan">You're a very nice man but you were
interfering with my business. </span> When?!

502
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:40,040
<span tts:color="cyan">When I was thinking.
</span> <span tts:color="yellow">When you were in a bad mood?
I wasn't!

503
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:46,280
<font color="yellow">No, listen...</font> <span tts:color="cyan">If I'm in a bad mood,
I flip in a bad mood.
Mervyn and... Do you?

504
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,800
Oh, I would throw you
across the room when I get angry.

505
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,000
So I don't bother getting angry
any more. I once was angry.

506
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,480
And so we drove on to Henley where,
for our last night,

507
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,400
Debbie was preparing
a special end-of-filming feast.

508
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,280
<font color="yellow">What's on the menu?</font> Apple and
mushroom soup...with hot bread...

509
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:22,800
<font color="yellow">Mmm!</font> Chicken in a marsala and
mushroom sauce, mashed potatoes,
beans and... <font color="yellow">Delicious!</font> ..carrots.

510
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,360
And then I've made a banoffee pie.

511
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,840
Amazing!

512
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,320
To the three of us.
<font color="cyan">To the three of us.</font> How's that?

513
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,240
<font color="lime">Menage a trois.</font> <font color="yellow">Cheers.</font> Pardon?!

514
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,000
<span tts:color="cyan">You say these words,
you've no idea what they mean. </span> I do!

515
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,520
I realised after I'd said it...
on camera.

516
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,560
D'you think this'll help the ballet,
you having done this documentary?

517
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,600
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font> <font color="lime">I hope so.</font> That's why
you did it. <font color="cyan">No.</font> Why did you do it?

518
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,640
We wanted to meet you. <span tts:color="yellow">Oh, please!
</span> We'd heard so much about you.

519
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,440
<span tts:color="yellow">I almost believed you for a second.
I've seen your programmes.

520
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,040
<font color="yellow">No, you haven't.</font> I saw that one
on swingers and wanted to meet you.

521
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,080
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font> You've just gone
from a menage a trois to swingers!

522
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,640
<font color="lime">I'm in that sort of mood.</font> I don't
know what's happened on this tour.

523
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,800
<font color="lime">Right, shall we...?</font> Can I admire
your outfit? It's amazing, isn't it?

524
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,800
I thought it was a skirt,
but it's a... <font color="lime">Catsuit.</font>

525
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,320
<span tts:color="yellow">A catsuit?
</span> Come out from behind the thing.

526
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,360
That's incredible.

527
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,760
<font color="yellow">Is that one piece?</font> <span tts:color="lime">Yes.
The frilly bits are built in.

528
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,520
<font color="yellow">Are they?</font> Hmm. Yeah.

529
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,040
<font color="yellow">Do it like this.</font> Not with
these glasses on the table.

530
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,040
What's a few glasses? Live a little!

531
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,640
One, two, three!

532
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,560
<font color="yellow">Isn't that cool?</font> Yeah.

533
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,640
PAUL LAUGHS

534
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,080
Sorry.

535
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,600
'I drank a fair amount that night.

536
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,360
'It all seemed very relaxed and we
were happy in each other's company.

537
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,040
'I don't think it was just the wine
that made me feel that.'

538
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,560
DEBBIE'S LAUGHTER DROWNS OUT PAUL

539
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,840
# When Irish eyes are smiling...! #

540
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,040
Tilt it up a bit.
<font color="cyan">Yeah!</font> There you go.

541
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,280
Too right.

542
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,000
And here we are
in the kitchen of Debbie McGee!

543
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,560
<span tts:color="lime">Where a garden gnome has come in
and sat down. </span> Thank you very much!

544
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,080
That's my office over there.

545
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,840
'A couple of glasses of wine later,
I was moved to say a few words.'

546
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,360
What I'm amazed by,
at the risk of being over-candid,

547
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,880
is that this is Debbie's dream

548
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:12,280
and I've been looking for tension,
the idea that Paul resents spending
a lot of money on it,

549
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,360
but I haven't really seen it.

550
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:20,320
Debbie did exactly the same thing
for me and the magic shows.

551
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,640
That surprised you.
<font color="yellow">You noticed?</font> Yeah.

552
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,680
You asked lots of questions saying,
"Don't you think that Paul...?"

553
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,960
<span tts:color="lime">I said no and now you know I wasn't
lying. </span> It upsets some journalists.

554
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font> I know you're a journalist
and it upsets them that we get along

555
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,640
and that we're happy together and
I think, "Get a life of your own.

556
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,160
"Stop poking into mine."

557
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,200
A genuinely happy couple is
a rare thing. <font color="cyan">No, it's not!</font> It is.

558
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,720
I think there's billions of us

559
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,920
and it's all the little
manky, miserable little people
who make the biggest shout.

560
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,000
You're so bitter.
Why did you get so angry?

561
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,080
I just think it's so sad
that these people have the voice,

562
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:16,280
when the truth is that most people
on the planet are very happy.

563
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,960
Paul and Debbie do seem happy.

564
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,000
They genuinely care for
and rely on each other,

565
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,520
united against the manky
and miserable little people,

566
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,040
a magic circle of two.

567
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,240
<span tts:color="cyan">Good to see you, son. Take care.
Do call again. I will.

568
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,960
Arrivederci. <span tts:color="yellow">Arrivederci.
</span> Hasta luego.

569
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,560
He could wipe it out!

570
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:02,480
See you, Louis!
Will we miss him? Not a lot!

571
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,520
He's all right.

572
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,280
We are totally mad!
